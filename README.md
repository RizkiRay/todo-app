## How to run the app
Because this is a new project (May 2024) then you can only open this project on Android Studio Iguana without any issues.
Then if all gradle download and sync is finished, you can run the app by clicking the green play button ![image](https://github.com/RizkiRay/todo-app/assets/7745848/23a1f905-bd55-4c83-9b88-17bfd99f49ef)
